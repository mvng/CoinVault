+ Need to scale Silver and Platinum with gold
- Handle JSON Parsing with Parse cloud code? Benefits -> Faster renders. ref: https://parse.com/questions/processing-json-in-cloud-code
+ Currently Date is being handled by quandl JSON aka there are no weekends.
- Highlighting SIDE NAV BAR does not do it correctly from every page
- Include Analytics -- Google Analytics maybe?
- grab real time value from "update"

# AddItem.html
- ADDITEM.html - need to grab "unit price" from the graph such that each page will have a real unit price and then do math from there.
+ 1. in additem.html - Need to restrict user date so that the user cannot add a coin past "today". I suggest possibly looking into this https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js as it kinda looks nice compared to jquery date ui
- Image included maybe? --- recolor based on type of metal selected would prolly work too

# Charting
- USER - DATA -graph , User Gold Total = how much gold they've had and incriment it to the right ---> such that $5 at the begining of time = $5 included at the end of they have not removed it. Deleting an item only removes from current Date. Updating an item is the trickiest
- On Generating DATE for the user, IF they dont have a range of -30, then create it Else create the date range from what they have, THEN Create a -30

# Bugs
- HTML5 Date picker does not work in Safari
- On FRESH USERS -- all graph functions require an extra refresh cycle
- Adding date BEFORE the 30 day chart, requires an extra reload cycle
- Tomorrow = NEW DAY. Graph does not reflect this...
