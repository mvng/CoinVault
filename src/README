Team Pentapod CSE 134B

TASKS AND PROBLEMS WE RAN INTO

Our team implemented a new Sign Up and Log in Process with Javascript and Parse database. We also gave our customers the options of signing in through their Facebook and Google accounts to have a easier and faster tool to sign up. After creating an account with an unique username and email, it will direct the user to the main dashboard where the user will be able to see the current prices for Gold, Silver, and Platinum as well as their current Gold Totals. 

In order to build the CRUD for our assignment, we utilized Parse and our own API to handle our backend applications as well as the operations on our webpage. We initially ran into problems using Parse, for example we had difficulties generating tables from read items, querying the right object, handling where an object exists, passing objects between different pages, etc. Additionally, a big issue we ran into was creating user's individual stacks and figuring out how to deal with the issue when Parse was deleting items too fast which caused some syncing issues.

We initially had difficulty implementing the graph on our website as we tried to incorporate data from Quandl with ChartJS. We grabbed the data from Quandl using PHP, however, we had a hard to decifering how to transfer that data over to our JS file that handled the creation of our graphs. Since none of us had previous knowledge of PHP, JSON, or AJAX, it took extensive research in order to create a functioning graph that pulled the data from Quandl. With the help of Cloud coding, as well as tweaking some our intial findings from the web, we finally were able to graph the data we retrieve from Quandl for Gold and other metals involved. In order to display the graph, we also had to use Heroku in order to run the PHP data from the server-side. 

Assumption - We didn't know the exact times for bullion trading so we made the open and close times from 6am to 1pm.
